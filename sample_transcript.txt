00:02
of sick so I I might kaufe lot which is
00:06
why this video will be heavily edited
00:09
and small announcement I remember I used
00:13
to have free resumes I would share my
00:17
resume and my resume template my cover
00:19
letters and my cover letter templates to
00:21
you guys
00:22
that link has been broken for the past
00:25
six months but I finally fixed them so
00:28
there during the description now so you
00:30
guys can check that out
00:31
sorry it took so long but alright let's
00:34
start the video okay so the first story
00:36
I want to talk about is that there was
00:38
someone who had a Google offer for two
00:41
hundred and seventy seven thousand
00:43
dollars total compensation at Google and
00:46
I thought that was pretty cool and I was
00:48
extremely jealous but this story was on
00:51
blind in case you don't know what
00:52
blindness is this anonymous forum it's
00:55
kind of like reddit but for work I
00:56
stumbled upon this post on blind
00:59
it's about this person who got a Google
01:01
offer and he said it was thanks to blind
01:05
you know he came from a Cs background at
01:07
a no-name public university apparently
01:09
and he had three years of experience and
01:12
a mid-sized tech company making a
01:14
hundred fifty K okay and then after his
01:19
hard work interviewing what happened is
01:21
he ended up with two hundred and seventy
01:24
seven thousand dollars total
01:26
compensation as an elf for at Google
01:30
if this isn't the American dream I don't
01:32
know what is now the threat was huge as
01:36
you can see there were so many people
01:37
congratulating him and asking him
01:39
follow-up questions blah blah blah
01:41
the threat is definitely worth reading
01:42
for people who want to interview for
01:44
Google cuz he gives actually a lot of
01:45
tips but I don't care about that I read
01:49
it because I never had anyone
01:51
congratulate me for my job
01:52
so I kind of pretended that was me yeah
01:56
anyways let's see how he did it I think
01:58
that's what you guys care about so
02:00
apparently the first thing he did is he
